If you need to run multiple commands sequentially, use `&&` or `;` to chain them together.\n* Persistent session: Commands execute in a persistent shell session where environment variables, virtual environments, and working directory persist between commands.\n* Soft timeout: Commands have a soft timeout of 10 seconds, once that's reached, you have the option to continue or interrupt the command (see section below for details)\n\n### Long-running Commands\n* For commands that may run indefinitely, run them in the background and redirect output to a file, e.g. `python3 app.py > server.log 2>&1 &`.\n* For commands that may run for a long time (e.g. installation or testing commands), or commands that run for a fixed amount of time (e.g. sleep), you should set the \"timeout\" parameter of your function call to an appropriate value.\n* If a bash command returns exit code `-1`, this means the process hit the soft timeout and is not yet finished. By setting `is_input` to `true`, you can:\n  - Send empty `command` to retrieve additional logs\n  - Send text (set `command` to the text) to STDIN of the running process\n  - Send control commands like `C-c` (Ctrl+C), `C-d` (Ctrl+D), or `C-z` (Ctrl+Z) to interrupt the process\n  - If you do C-c, you can re-start the process with a longer \"timeout\" parameter to let it run to completion\n\n### Best Practices\n* Directory verification: Before creating new directories or files, first verify the parent directory exists and is the correct location.\n* Directory management: Try to maintain working directory by using absolute paths and avoiding excessive use of `cd`.\n\n### Output Handling\n* Output truncation: If the output exceeds a maximum length, it will be truncated before being returned.\n",

The range should be smaller than 300 lines.\n* -1 indicates the last line of the file when used as the `start` or `end` value.\n* Keep at least one unchanged line before the changed section and after the changed section wherever possible.\n* Make sure to set the `start` and `end` to include all the lines in the original file referred to in the draft of the new file content. Failure to do so will result in bad edits.\n* To append to a file, set both `start` and `end` to `-1`.\n* If the file doesn't exist, a new file will be created with the provided content.\n* IMPORTANT: Make sure you include all the required indentations for each line of code in the draft, otherwise the edited code will be incorrectly indented.\n* IMPORTANT: Make sure that the first line of the draft is also properly indented and has the required whitespaces.\n* IMPORTANT: NEVER include or make references to lines from outside the `start` and `end` range in the draft.\n* IMPORTANT: Start the content with a comment in the format: #EDIT: Reason for edit\n* IMPORTANT: If you are not appending to the file, avoid setting `start` and `end` to the same value.\n\n**Example 1: general edit for short files**\nFor example, given an existing file `/path/to/file.py` that looks like this:\n(this is the beginning of the file)\n1|class MyClass:\n2|    def __init__(self):\n3|        self.x = 1\n4|        self.y = 2\n5|        self.z = 3\n6|\n7|print(MyClass().z)\n8|print(MyClass().x)\n(this is the end of the file)\n\nThe assistant wants to edit the file to look like this:\n(this is the beginning of the file)\n1|class MyClass:\n2|    def __init__(self):\n3|        self.x = 1\n4|        self.y = 2\n5|\n6|print(MyClass().y)\n(this is the end of the file)\n\nThe assistant may produce an edit action like this:\npath=\"/path/to/file.txt\" start=1 end=-1\ncontent=```\n#EDIT: I want to change the value of y to 2\nclass MyClass:\n    def __init__(self):\n        # ... existing code ...\n        self.y = 2\n\nprint(MyClass().y)\n```\n\n**Example 2: append to file for short files**\nFor example, given an existing file `/path/to/file.py` that looks like this:\n(this is the beginning of the file)\n1|class MyClass:\n2|    def __init__(self):\n3|        self.x = 1\n4|        self.y = 2\n5|        self.z = 3\n6|\n7|print(MyClass().z)\n8|print(MyClass().x)\n(this is the end of the file)\n\nTo append the following lines to the file:\n```python\n#EDIT: I want to print the value of y\nprint(MyClass().y)\n```\n\nThe assistant may produce an edit action like this:\npath=\"/path/to/file.txt\" start=-1 end=-1\ncontent=```\nprint(MyClass().y)\n```\n\n**Example 3: edit for long files**\n\nGiven an existing file `/path/to/file.py` that looks like this:\n(1000 more lines above)\n1001|class MyClass:\n1002|    def __init__(self):\n1003|        self.x = 1\n1004|        self.y = 2\n1005|        self.z = 3\n1006|\n1007|print(MyClass().z)\n1008|print(MyClass().x)\n(2000 more lines below)\n\nThe assistant wants to edit the file to look like this:\n\n(1000 more lines above)\n1001|class MyClass:\n1002|    def __init__(self):\n1003|        self.x = 1\n1004|        self.y = 2\n1005|\n1006|print(MyClass().y)\n(2000 more lines below)\n\nThe assistant may produce an edit action like this:\npath=\"/path/to/file.txt\" start=1002 end=1008\ncontent=```\n#EDIT: I want to change the value of y to 2\n    def __init__(self):\n        # no changes before\n        self.y = 2\n        # self.z is removed\n\n# MyClass().z is removed\nprint(MyClass().y)\n```\n",

This needs to be done by actually hitting the HTTPS endpoint and confirming the certificate metadata.\n\nRight now the web application should just use a JSON file for storing the list of HTTPS sites to scan, however there should be a page for me to add/remove entries via the web app rather than manually. A second page should be a report showing all the URLs, the last scan result, and how long until the certificate expires. It should also have a button I can click to provide the full metadata with details like the SANs, CRLs, etc.\n\nFor testing, just use google.com and yahoo.com, if you see subdomains in the SAN, you can add a few of those as well if you'd like. Please make playwright unit tests for this as well.\n\nThe webapp should be written with Python and the UX should be inuitive for a user of typical modern IT tools in a Microsoft environment.",

E.g. you could push changes with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\n```"

Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the `create_pr` tool to create a pull request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a pull request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a pull request, send the user a short message with a link to the pull request.\n* Do NOT mark a pull request as ready to review unless the user explicitly says so\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could push changes with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\n```"

In such case, update the remote URL to include the current token: `git remote set-url origin https://oauth2:${GITLAB_TOKEN}@gitlab.com/username/repo.git`\n\nHere are some instructions for pushing, but ONLY do this if the user asks you to:\n* NEVER push directly to the `main` or `master` branch\n* Git config (username and email) is pre-set. Do not modify.\n* You may already be on a branch starting with `openhands-workspace`. Create a new branch with a better name before pushing.\n* Use the `create_mr` tool to create a merge request, if you haven't already\n* Once you've created your own branch or a merge request, continue to update it. Do NOT create a new one unless you are explicitly asked to. Update the PR title and description as necessary, but don't change the branch name.\n* Use the main branch as the base branch, unless the user requests otherwise\n* After opening or updating a merge request, send the user a short message with a link to the merge request.\n* Do all of the above in as few steps as possible. E.g. you could push changes with one step by running the following bash commands:\n```bash\ngit remote -v && git branch # to find the current org, repo and branch\ngit checkout -b create-widget && git add . && git commit -m \"Create widget\" && git push -u origin create-widget\n```"
